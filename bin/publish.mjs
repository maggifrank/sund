/* Publish the date a swim happened — not the hour, and not the pool.
 *

 * a pool to a date says which neighbourhood they were in on which day. Neither
 * is needed by anything on the public page: the count, cost per trip,
 * break-even and the monthly chart all work off dates alone, and the pool table
 * is published as totals (see poolTable()) rather than per trip. Both are
 * dropped from the snapshot rather than hidden in the page, or they would still
 * sit in state.json for anyone who opened it directly.
 *
 * Anchoring at local midday keeps the date and the count while dropping the
 * time, and matches the convention backdated trips already use.
 *
 * Every swim, not just the ones on the card. This used to publish cardTrips()
 * alone, which was invisible until the card grew dates: from then on the public
 * chart began at the season start and the months before it simply vanished,
 * while the app beside it still drew the lot. The page is meant to be the same
 * picture with the controls taken away, and "it shows in the chart, the history
 * and the pool table, but never in the money" is the rule the app states for an
 * off-card swim — so the money here reads `totals.counted` and the drawings get
 * the whole history.
 *
 * That publishes the dates of swims the card does not cover. It is the same
 * disclosure the card's own swims already make, and the page already publishes
 * `totals.all` and a pool table counted over everything, so how much swimming
 * there was outside the card was never the secret — only when. The hour and the
 * pool, which are what actually locate someone, stay dropped. */

 * so the finished rows are what gets published: an id, a name, a count and
 * whether the card covers it. That is deliberately the whole of it. Sending the
 * pool list instead would ship every pool's coordinates, and leaving the pool on
 * each trip would say which pool on which day; a total says where the swimming
 * happened without dating any of it.
 *
 * The id is the one field nothing on the page displays. It is here so the map
 * can match a row to a position, and it is safe to publish because it says
 * nothing the name beside it does not: it is a slug of that name, both are
 * already on the page, and every coordinate it resolves to is in lib/pools.js,
 * which this build has always shipped. Matching on the name instead would break
 * the moment a pool was renamed — the app supports renaming one, and the
 * renamed pool would silently fall off the map rather than move.
 *
 * Counted over the full state, which is now also what the trips cover, so the
 * table's total and `totals.all` and the history's length are three views of one
 * number. The `card` flag on each row comes from poolCounts(), so it follows
 * whichever pools the card is set to cover rather than the built-in list. */
